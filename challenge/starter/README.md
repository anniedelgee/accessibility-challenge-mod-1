# Module 1: Accessibility in HTML and CSS

## Project Overview
This is a code refactor with the sole purpose of making the webpage more accesible. This meant organising the code with semantic html, image 'alt's and fixing broken links. Edits were made to the html and css codes. Aside from making the page work as it should, for a user, cleaning up the code itself so that it is more legible for future alterations, was an important technique to learn. I look forward to building on this framework and introducing repsonsive design and later, interactivity.
